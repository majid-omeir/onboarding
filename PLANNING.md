PLANNING.md – Cloudflare Onboarding & Feedback System

\==============================

1. Vision
   \==============================
   Our goal is to deliver a seamless, five‑minute onboarding journey hosted entirely on Cloudflare’s edge network. New customers will be able to create an account, complete profile setup, sign required terms, and immediately provide feedback. The experience should feel instant worldwide, collect actionable insights for continuous improvement, and maintain enterprise‑grade security and availability (≥99.9 %).

Key value propositions:

* Increase conversion by reducing friction during signup.
* Capture user sentiment in real time to guide product refinement.
* Leverage Cloudflare’s global edge to minimize latency without server maintenance overhead.

Success will be measured by:

* ≥85 % onboarding completion rate.
* ≤5 minute average time‑to‑complete.
* ≥40 % feedback response rate within 24 hours.
* <2 critical defects per quarter.

2\. High‑Level Architecture
===========================

Client (Browser)
└─ Cloudflare Pages (static React front‑end)
└─ Fetch ➜ Cloudflare Worker API (TypeScript)
├─ KV (transient step data)
├─ Durable Objects (per‑user session consistency)
└─ Webhooks ➜ Internal CRM / Notifications

Admin UI (Phase 2)
└─ Protected by Cloudflare Access
└─ Calls same Worker API for metrics

Data & Monitoring
├─ Cloudflare Analytics & Logpush
└─ Alerting via Cloudflare Notifications or external webhook

Security Layers
├─ HTTPS (TLS 1.3)
├─ JWT auth for API calls
├─ Rate limiting & WAF rules
└─ Input sanitization / CSRF tokens

\==============================
3\. Technology Stack
====================

Frontend

* React 18 with Vite build tool
* Tailwind CSS for utility styling
* TypeScript for static typing

Backend / Edge

* Cloudflare Workers (TypeScript, wrangler v4)
* Cloudflare KV (key‑value store)
* Cloudflare Durable Objects (optional)
* Cloudflare Access for admin protection
* Cloudflare Pages for static hosting & CI/CD

Build & CI/CD

* GitHub Actions (lint, test, deploy)
* wrangler deploy (automatic on push to main)

Testing

* Vitest for unit tests
* Miniflare for Worker integration tests
* Playwright for E2E browser flows

Analytics & Monitoring

* Cloudflare Analytics dashboard
* Logpush to R2 or external SIEM
* Alert triggers via Cloudflare Notifications

\==============================
4\. Required Tools List
=======================

Developer Environment

* Node.js 20 LTS
* npm v10+ (or Yarn 3)
* wrangler CLI (Cloudflare Workers)
* GitHub CLI (optional)

Code Quality & Formatting

* ESLint (airbnb‑base + TypeScript rules)
* Prettier (project‑wide formatting)
* Husky + lint‑staged (pre‑commit hooks)

Collaboration & Docs

* GitHub Projects (kanban board)
* Figma for wireframes and prototypes
* PRD, CLAUDE.md, and PLANNING.md maintained in /docs

Testing & QA

* Vitest (unit)
* Playwright (E2E)
* Miniflare (local Worker simulation)
* Lighthouse CI (performance budgets)

Monitoring & Ops

* Cloudflare Analytics & Logpush
* PagerDuty or Opsgenie (alerts)
* Sentry (optional edge exception tracking)

Optional Integrations

* Third‑party e‑signature API (to be selected)
* Email service (Postmark, SendGrid) for feedback reminders

\==============================
5\. Next Steps
==============

1. Confirm e‑signature provider and data retention policy.
2. Finalize Figma wireframes (Week 1–2).
3. Set up GitHub repo with suggested directory layout and CI pipeline.
4. Begin Pages scaffold and Worker API stubs.
